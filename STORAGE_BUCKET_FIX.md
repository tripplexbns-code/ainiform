# Firebase Storage Bucket Fix

## Problem
The application was showing "storage bucket not configured" error when trying to use Firebase Storage.

## Solution
The issue was that the `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` environment variable was not set. The application now automatically detects the correct storage bucket name from the Firebase service account file.

## What was fixed:
1. **Enhanced Firebase configuration** - Added automatic bucket name detection from service account
2. **Environment variable support** - Added support for `.env` file and environment variables
3. **Unicode compatibility** - Fixed emoji character encoding issues on Windows
4. **Better error messages** - Improved error reporting and troubleshooting tips

## How to run the application:

### Option 1: Use the fixed launcher script
```bash
python set_env_and_run.py
```

### Option 2: Use the Windows batch file
```bash
run_with_storage_fix.bat
```

### Option 3: Set environment variable manually
```bash
set FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=ainiform-system-c42de.appspot.com
python web_server.py
```

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are now supported:
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Firebase Storage bucket name (auto-detected if not set)
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID (auto-detected if not set)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key for sessions
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Cloudinary cloud name for image uploads
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Cloudinary API secret

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Storage bucket is now properly configured and the error is resolved.
